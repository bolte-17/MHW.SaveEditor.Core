# MHW.SaveEditor.Core
Refactoring and fork of AsteriskAmpersand's Monster Hunter World Save Editor ([@AsteriskAmpersand/MHW-Save-Editor](https://github.com/AsteriskAmpersand/MHW-Save-Editor)).
Goal is to extract the core logic and functionality out and separate it from the Windows Desktop UI.

Partially an excuse to try out new features from C#8 / .NET Standard 2.2 / .NET Core 3.0.
